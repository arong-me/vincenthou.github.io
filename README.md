Personal blog to track my work

# Introduction

This site is generated by hexo and use yillia theme. All the configuration based on hexo and yillia theme are placed in _config.yml file.

# Deploy

I use [hexo-deployer-git](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git) as hexo deployer, hexo provide a simple command to push generated static resouce to github repo.

```
hexo deploy
```

Related configuration can be found [here](https://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html#Git)

# Migration

Hexo provide some awesome migration tools for transforming original posts (RSS, Jekyll, Octopress, wordPress, joomla) to hexo recognized format, refer [here](https://hexo.io/docs/migration.html). I prefer to write article in issues, so I find a good [tool](https://github.com/songchenwen/hexo-migrator-issue), run and command before deployment.

```
hexo migrate issue
```
